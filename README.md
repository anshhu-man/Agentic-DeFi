## Sponsors & Why We Used Them

### Fluence

**Why did we use it?** Fluence provides CPU-only virtual servers, enabling efficient deployment of AI agents and inference APIs without GPU requirements. This aligns with the hackathonâ€™s goal of demonstrating impactful, resource-efficient AI on Fluence VMs. It allows us to build scalable, cost-effective agentic backends and inference APIs. The decentralized nature of Fluence also enhances reliability and censorship resistance for DeFi applications.

**Impact:** By leveraging Fluence, our project demonstrates how advanced AI and agentic workflows can be run efficiently on distributed infrastructure, paving the way for more accessible and robust DeFi services.

 Fluence Virtual Servers â€” Prize Submission

## What it does: Project Purpose and Overview

Agentic-DeFi leverages Fluence Virtual Servers to deploy AI-powered agentic backends for decentralized finance. The backend runs entirely on CPU-only Fluence VMs, orchestrating autonomous agents that analyze market data, interact with smart contracts, and execute trading strategies. This demonstrates how efficient, scalable AI can be achieved without GPUs, using distributed infrastructure.

## How to set it up: Full Setup Instructions

1. **Provision a Fluence VM**
  - Follow Fluence documentation to create a CPU-only VM.
  - Note the VM ID and public endpoint.
2. **Clone the repository**
  ```powershell
  git clone <private-repo-url>
  cd Agentic-DeFi
  ```
3. **Install backend dependencies**
  ```powershell
  cd backend
  npm install
  ```
4. **Configure environment variables**
  - Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill in required secrets.
5. **Deploy backend to Fluence VM**
  - Use provided Terraform/Ansible scripts in `scripts/` for automated deployment, or follow manual steps in `backend/README.md`.
  - Ensure required ports are open for API access.
6. **Verify deployment**
  - Access the backend API at `http://<fluence-vm-endpoint>:<port>`.

## How to run it: Runtime Guidance and Usage Steps

1. **Start backend on Fluence VM**
  ```powershell
  npm run start
  ```
2. **Monitor logs**
  - Use SSH or Fluence dashboard to view logs and agent activity.
3. **Interact with API**
  - Use Postman, curl, or the frontend to call backend endpoints.
  - Example: `GET /api/pyth/price?symbol=ETHUSD` returns latest price feed.

### Pyth Network

**About Pyth Network:** Pyth is a leading oracle network that delivers high-frequency, real-time price data from institutional sources directly to blockchains. Its Pull Oracle model allows dApps to fetch and update price feeds on demand, ensuring accuracy and minimizing latency. Pyth supports a wide range of assets and is integrated with major DeFi protocols.

**Why did we use it?** Pythâ€™s Pull Oracle allows our dApp to fetch real-time price feeds, update them on-chain, and consume them for trading and risk management. This enables innovative DeFi use cases and meets the requirements for the Pyth prize. Pyth is essential for secure, reliable, and up-to-date price data in our agentic workflows. The flexibility of the Pull model also allows us to optimize costs and update frequency based on our needs.

**Impact:** Integrating Pyth enables our agents and smart contracts to make informed decisions using trusted, up-to-date market data, improving the safety and efficiency of DeFi strategies.

**Prize:** Top three teams with best and most innovative use of Pyth Price feeds.

### 1inch

**About 1inch:** 1inch is a leading decentralized exchange aggregator and protocol, known for its Limit Order Protocol that enables highly customizable and efficient order execution on-chain. The protocol supports advanced order types, hooks, and composable strategies, making it a powerful tool for building innovative DeFi applications.

**Why did we use it?** The 1inch Limit Order Protocol is leveraged to build advanced trading strategies and hooks, enabling flexible, programmable order execution and agentic trading logic. It provides the foundation for innovative, automated DeFi strategies and meets the requirements for the 1inch prize. The protocolâ€™s extensibility allows us to implement custom agentic logic and integrate seamlessly with our backend and smart contracts.

**Impact:** By building on 1inch, our project showcases new possibilities for automated, agent-driven trading and liquidity management, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in DeFi.

**Prize:** For the most innovative and complete strategies built on top of the Limit Order Protocol.
