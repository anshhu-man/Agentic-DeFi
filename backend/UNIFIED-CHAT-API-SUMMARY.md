### 2. **Key Features**
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Integrates with AgenticOrchestrator
- ✅ **Natural Language Processing**: Semantic intent analysis and routing
- ✅ **Conversational Responses**: AI-powered response generation
- ✅ **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history
- ✅ **Agent Transparency**: Shows which agents were consulted
- ✅ **Follow-up Suggestions**: Generates contextual next questions
- ✅ **Entity Extraction**: Identifies tokens, protocols, and chains
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error responses

### 3. **Supported Agent Types**
- **AgenticYieldAgent**: Advanced yield optimization with autonomous decision making
- **YieldAgent**: Traditional yield farming strategies  
- **RiskAgent**: Risk assessment and portfolio monitoring
- **GovernanceAgent**: DAO governance participation
- **EnhancedYieldAgent**: Enhanced strategies with Pyth price feeds

## 🔗 **API Endpoints**

### Main Chat Endpoint
```http
POST /api/chat/agents
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "What are the best yield opportunities for USDC?",
  "userId": "user123",
  "mode": "analyze_only",
  "userProfile": {
    "riskTolerance": "medium",
    "experienceLevel": "intermediate"
  }
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "reply": "Based on my analysis of current market conditions...",
    "agentInsights": {
      "primaryAgent": "AgenticYieldAgent",
      "confidence": 0.85,

## 📁 **Files Created**

### Core Implementation
- `src/controllers/enhancedChatController.ts` - Main chat controller with agent integration
- `src/index.ts` - Updated to include new chat routes

### Testing & Demo
- `test-chat-server.js` - Standalone test server with mock responses
- `test-chat-demo.js` - Comprehensive demonstration script
- `test-chat-simple.js` - Simple test script
- `test-server-ready.js` - Server readiness checker

### Documentation
- `README-CHAT-AGENTS.md` - Comprehensive API documentation
- `UNIFIED-CHAT-API-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### 1. Start the Test Server
```bash
cd Agentic-DeFi/backend
node test-chat-server.js
```

### 2. Run the Demo
```bash
node test-chat-demo.js
```

### 3. Test with cURL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "What are the best yield opportunities for USDC?",
    "userId": "test_user",
    "mode": "analyze_only"
  }'
```
