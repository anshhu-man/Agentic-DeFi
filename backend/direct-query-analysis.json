Polygon's low transaction costs (~$0.01–$0.10) and high throughput (7,000+ TPS) make it attractive for yield farming, but the following risks dominate:\n\n    1. **Smart Contract Risks**:\n       - Polygon hosts unaudited or poorly audited protocols (e.g., newer forks of Yearn or Curve).\n       - *Example*: The **$600M Poly Network exploit (2021)** targeted cross-chain bridges, a vulnerability still relevant today.\n       - *Actionable*: Stick to audited protocols like **Aave Polygon (v3)**, **QuickSwap**, or **Balancer Polygon pools** with bug bounty programs.\n\n    2. **Impermanent Loss (IL) Volatility**:\n       - Current ETH price (**$4,013.33**) is near ATHs, increasing IL risk for ETH-paired LPs (e.g., ETH-USDC pools).\n       - *Data*: A 10% ETH price swing could cause **~0.5% IL** in stablecoin pairs but **~5% IL** in ETH/USDC 50-50 pools.\n       - *Actionable*: Farm single-sided staking pools (e.g., **Stargate’s USDC pool**) or use IL protection tools like **Visor Finance**.\n\n    3. **Liquidity Risks**:\n       - Polygon’s TVL ($1.2B, down 40% YoY) is concentrated in **top 5 protocols (Aave, QuickSwap, SushiSwap, Balancer, Curve)**.\n       - *Risk*: Smaller pools may face **exit liquidity crunches** during market downturns (e.g., MATIC dropping 20% in 24h).\n       - *Actionable*: Avoid pools with <$5M TVL; use **DefiLlama’s Polygon dashboard** to track liquidity depth.\n\n    4. **Oracle Manipulation**:\n       - Polygon relies on **Chainlink + native oracles**, but smaller pools may use **single-source oracles** (e.g., Uniswap TWAP).\n       - *Example*: The **$100M MIMO exploit (2022)** on Polygon exploited oracle delays.\n       - *Actionable*: Farm pools using **Chainlink Price Feeds** (e.g., Aave v3) or **Pyth Network** (now live on Polygon).\n\n    5. **Regulatory & Bridge Risks**:\n       - Polygon’s **PoS bridge** (used for 70% of cross-chain TVL) is a **centralized attack vector**.\n       - *Data*: **$2B+ lost in bridge hacks (2022–2024)** per Chainalysis.\n       - *Actionable*: Use **LayerZero or Celer cBridge** for cross-chain yields; avoid anonymous teams.\n\n    6. **MATIC Token Risk**:\n       - MATIC’s price (**$0.50–",
