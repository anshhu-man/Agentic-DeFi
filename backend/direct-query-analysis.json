For example:\n      - ETH at $3,500 (hypothetical reference) with 80% LTV → Liquidation if ETH drops to **$2,800** (20% buffer).\n      - BTC at $60,000 with 85% LTV → Liquidation if BTC drops to **$51,000** (15% buffer).\n    - **Volatility Triggers:** ETH and BTC historically exhibit **±10-15% daily swings** during high-leverage market stress (e.g., macroeconomic news, exchange outflows). Altcoins (e.g., SOL, AVAX) may see **±20-30%** swings.\n    - **Protocol-Specific Risks:**\n      - **Aave/Compound:** Liquidation penalties (5-10%) + gas spikes can erode collateral further.\n      - **MakerDAO:** Requires active monitoring of Stability Fees (currently 5-8% for ETH vaults).\n      - **LSTs (Lido, Rocket Pool):** stETH/ETH depeg risk (currently ~0.2% spread) adds layer of risk for leveraged positions.\n    - **Macro Context:** Rising USD interest rates and reduced stablecoin liquidity (e.g., USDC dominance at 25%) increase systemic risk for overcollateralized positions.\n    \",\n\n    \"recommendations\": [\n      \"\n      **1. Immediate Collateral Top-Up:**\n      - For ETH positions: If your LTV is > **70%**, deposit additional ETH or stablecoins to reduce LTV below **60%** (target: 50% for safety).\n      - For BTC positions: Maintain LTV < **55%** to account for higher volatility.\n      - *Action:* Use [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) or [DeBank](https://debank.com) to simulate top-up scenarios.\n      \",\n      \"\n      **2. Switch to Low-Volatility Collateral:**\n      - Replace ETH/BTC with stablecoins (USDC, DAI) or low-vol assets (e.g., LUSD, sUSD) for loans. Example:\n        - On Aave, borrow USDC against **LUSD** (Liquity’s stablecoin) to avoid ETH price exposure.\n      \",\n      \"\n      **3. Leverage Alert Tools:**\n      - Set up liquidation alerts via:\n        - [Tenderly Liquidation Bot](https://tenderly.co) (for custom thresholds).\n        - [DeFi Saver](https://defisaver.com) (auto-repay/boost collateral).\n      - Example alert: Trigger at **LTV = 65%** for ETH (well before liquidation at 80%).\n      \",\n      \"\n      **4.

Below is a breakdown of the **top 7 risks**, ranked by severity, along with Polygon-specific considerations and mitigation strategies.\n\n    ---\n\n    ### **1. Smart Contract Risks (Critical - Severity: 9/10)**\n    - **Issue**: Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem includes many unaudited or poorly audited protocols. Exploits (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan attacks) are common.\n    - **Polygon-Specific**:\n      - 60+ exploits occurred on Polygon in 2023 (e.g., **Platypus Finance [$9M loss, Feb 2023]**, **Jimbo’s Protocol [$7.5M, Oct 2023]**).\n      - Even audited protocols like **Aave Polygon** and **QuickSwap** have faced minor vulnerabilities.\n    - **Mitigation**:\n      - Stick to **battle-tested protocols** (Aave, Balancer, SushiSwap on Polygon).\n      - Use **DeFi insurance** (e.g., [Unslashed Finance](https://unslashed.finance/), [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/)).\n      - Verify audits via **CertiK, OpenZeppelin, or Quantstamp**.\n\n    ---\n\n    ### **2. Impermanent Loss (IL) (High - Severity: 8/10)**\n    - **Issue**: IL occurs when deposited tokens’ prices diverge significantly, reducing LP position value vs. HODLing.\n    - **Polygon-Specific**:\n      - High volatility in **MATIC-based pairs** (e.g., MATIC/ETH, MATIC/USDC) due to MATIC’s beta (~1.8 vs. ETH).\n      - **Example**: If MATIC drops **20%** while ETH drops **10%**, IL in a MATIC/ETH pool can exceed **10%**.\n    - **Mitigation**:\n      - Farm **stablecoin pairs** (USDC/DAI, USDT/USDC) to minimize IL.\n      - Use **IL protection tools** like [Bancor v3](https://bancor.network/) (if available on Polygon).\n      - Avoid **high-beta assets** (e.g., meme coins, low-cap alts).\n\n    ---\n\n    ### **3. Bridge Risks (High - Severity: 8/10)**\n    - **Issue**: Polygon relies on **PoS bridge** (and third-party bridges like **Synapse, Hop, Stargate**) for cross-chain liquidity. Bridge hacks are frequent.\n    - **Polygon-Specific**:\n      - **$2B+ lost** in cross-chain bridge exploits (2022-2023), including **Polygon’s Plasma Bridge (deprecated but still a risk for legacy funds)**.\n      - **Centralization risk**: Polygon’s PoS bridge is secured by **100+ validators**, but a **2/3 malicious majority** could theoretically freeze/censor funds.\n    - **Mitigation**:\n      - Use **official Polygon PoS bridge** (avoid third-party bridges).\n      - Withdraw",
